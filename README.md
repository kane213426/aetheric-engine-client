# Aetheric Engine TCP Client

This Python script connects to the mysterious "Aetheric Engine" via TCP, authenticates using a JWT token, listens for both ASCII and binary messages, and logs them to an SQLite database.

## Features

- âœ… TCP socket connection
- âœ… JWT-based authentication
- âœ… Parses ASCII and binary message formats
- âœ… Writes to SQLite with full metadata
- âœ… Handles decoding (UTF-8, Latin-1, Base64 fallback)
- âœ… Validates ASCII formatting rules
- âœ… Logs all events/errors to `ae_client_log.txt`

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### 1. Connect to the Server
- Uses Pythonâ€™s built-in `socket` library.
- Sends the authentication command:  
  `AUTH <JWT_Token>`

### 2. Receive and Parse Messages
- Data is streamed continuously â€” proper buffer management is essential.

#### ASCII Messages
- Start with `$`, end with `;`.
- Payload must be **â‰¥5 printable characters**, excluding `$` and `;`.

#### Binary Messages
- Start with **byte `0xAA`**.
- Next **5 bytes**: big-endian integer indicating the payload size.
- Followed by the **payload**: random bytes.

### 3. Write to SQLite
- Uses Pythonâ€™s `sqlite3` module.
- Stores messages with metadata:
  - `payload`, `length`, `received_at`, `decoded`, and `valid`

### 4. Termination
- Stops after receiving **600 messages**.
- Sends the command: `STATUS`  
- Then closes the socket connection.

### 5. Validation App
- An independent script validates all saved messages by:
  - Connecting to the same SQLite DB
  - Ensuring **no malformed or partial messages**
  - Confirming **â‰¥600 total messages received and parsed correctly**
